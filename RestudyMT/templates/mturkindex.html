		<h1> Call for participants</h1>
		<p>The Cognition and Computation Lab at New York University (NYU) is looking
		for online participants for a brief experiment on how people learn. The
		experiment can be run right at your desk. The only requirements are that
		you are at least 18 years old and are a fluent English speaker.
		</p>
                <p>
                If you finish the experiment, you will be paid a minimum of $3.00. You may also earn
                a bonus of up to approximately $5.00 depending on your performance in the task.
                </b>  
                Most people finish in 40-50 minutes, so please only accept the hit if you have enough
                time to complete it. This experiment must be run from a computer with a keyboard
                (not on a mobile device or tablet).
		</p>
		<p>This task can only be completed once.  Thus, if you have already
		    completed this task before the system will not allow you to run again.  If this
		    looks familiar please release the hit so someone else can participate.</p>

		Otherwise, please click the "Accept Hit" button on the Amazon site above to begin the task.
